	abstract = {This article constitutes a state-of-the-art review of the literature on the effects of expectations on the sensory perception of food and drink by humans. In the 'Introduction', we summarize the theoretical models of expectations that have been put forward. In the 'Empirical research utilizing direct methods' section, we describe the influence that expectations created by a variety of product extrinsic cues have on sensory perception, hedonic appraisal, and intake/consumption. We critically evaluate the evidence that has emerged from both laboratory studies and real-world research conducted in the setting of the restaurant, canteen, and bar. This literature review is focused primarily on those studies that have demonstrated an effect on tasting. Crucially, this review goes beyond previous work in the area by highlighting the relevant cognitive neuroscience literature (see the section 'Applied research through the lens of cognitive neuroscience methods') and the postulated psychological mechanisms of expectation in terms of recent accounts of predictive coding and Bayesian decision theory (see the 'Predictive coding and expectations'section).},

	abstract = {Color is perhaps the single most important product-intrinsic sensory cue when it comes to setting our expectations regarding the likely taste and flavor of food and drink. To date, a large body of research has demonstrated that changing the hue or intensity/saturation of the color of a variety of different food and beverage items exerts a sometimes dramatic impact on the expectations, and often on the subsequent taste/flavor experiences of participants in the lab, as well as consumers under the more naturalistic conditions of everyday life. It is important to note that food colors can have rather different meanings, and hence give rise to differing expectations in these different age groups, not to mention in those from different cultures. By gaining a better understanding of the sensory and hedonic expectations that are elicited by food color in different groups of individuals, researchers are now coming to better understand the various ways in which what we see can modulate the multisensory perception of flavor, and alter our food behaviors.},

	abstract = {Statistical mediation allows researchers to investigate potential causal effects of experimental manipulations through intervening variables. It is a powerful tool for assessing the presence and strength of postulated causal mechanisms. Although mediation is used in certain areas of psychology, it is rarely applied in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. One reason for the scarcity of applications is that these areas of psychology commonly employ within-subjects designs, and mediation models for within-subjects data are considerably more complicated than for between-subjects data. Here, we draw attention to the importance and ubiquity of mediational hypotheses in within-subjects designs, and we present a general and flexible software package for conducting Bayesian within-subjects mediation analyses in the R programming environment. We use experimental data from cognitive psychology to illustrate the benefits of within-subject mediation for theory testing and comparison.},

	abstract = {Before consuming a food or beverage, consumers are exposed to many sources of information related to the product. Such product-related cues can generate expectations, some of which can improve consumers' sensory perception and liking of the product. The question posed in the current study is whether labelling and colour of beer can be used to modify consumers' expectations and improve perception of its taste, flavour and mouthfeel, as these properties can be problematic in reduced alcohol beers. The aim of the current study was to explore how the most salient extrinsic and intrinsic cues affect expectations and perception in the context of beer. Using a repeated measures design, 72 participants viewed label-based sensory information and tasted 16 beer samples differing in colour and bitterness. Participants rated expected and perceived liking, bitterness, refreshment, and body. As predicted, both sensory descriptor and beer colour generated sensory and hedonic expectations. We have also demonstrated that expectations mediate the effect of product related cues on perception and liking. Beer colour affected perceived liking, bitterness, refreshment, and body both directly and indirectly, yet the sensory descriptor ‘bitter’ only affected sensory perception and liking indirectly. Overall, we conclude that extrinsic and intrinsic cues can together change expectations and more importantly perception and thus potentially compensate for the perceived deficits in taste, flavour and mouthfeel commonly found in reduced alcohol beers.},
